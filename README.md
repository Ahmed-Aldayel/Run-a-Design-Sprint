1. Understand the problem. 
2. Define. by defining and focusing on the desired outcomes.
3. Sketch. by Generate ideas for possible solutions based on the theme that i selected.
4. Decide. by Pick the final concept that i want to develop into a prototype.
5. Prototype. by Turn my concept into a realistic.
6. Validate. by Users that will go through my prototype and provide feedback on my concept.
7. Handoff. by Refine the problem and goals section (if needed), Complete the Key Features and Scope section and Link my mocks to the PRD.
